# Two-Stage-Network-Super-Resolution
This is an unofficial code replication for a "Two-stage Network For Single Image Super-Resolution" paper. However, there are some modifications to improve the results, specifically, the Sobel kernel-based loss function. If you find any error or deviation from the original paper let me know. If you use this code, don't forget to cite the original paper:
